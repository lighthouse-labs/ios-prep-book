# More Objects

## Goal

In this challenge you will create a new Command Line app to manipulates more foundation objects. 

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Create objects using the `NSDate` and `NSDateFormatter` class.

Big Nerd Ranch:

These following chapters mention some things that we haven’t really learned about yet like Structs, Stack, and Heap. Knowledge of these topics are not required, but we recognize some students may find some additional context helpful. If you would like more information on these topics, you can read chatpers 9-12 in the Big Nerd Ranch, or you can check out this [high level overview](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/ios-prep-book/issues/37) that we’ve put together.

## Exercise

>
* Start by creating a new Xcode project called Strings, and navigate to the `main.m` file.

#### Create a number

>
* The first thing you're going to do is create a new object with the type `NSNumber`. Call this object `age` and set it's value to be your age.
* Now use NSLog to print out the value of this new object. Remember to use `%@` to print the value of an object.

#### Create a date

>
* Create an `NSDate` object called `now` by calling `[NSDate date]`. This creates a variable that represents the date a the time it was created.
* Print this date out to the console.

#### Create a better date

That was pretty basic. What if we want to create a date object for a speicific date? There's a couple of different options here, but we're going to explore the `NSDateFormatter` class that will allow us to create a date from a string object like `@"2017-07-24"`. For more information on how this works, and the different kinds of strings that can be formatted, check out the Date Formatting Guide in the extra readings.

>
* Create a new `NSDateFormatter` object called `formatter` by calling `[[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];`
* `NSDateFormatter` has a property called `dateFormat` that accepts a string for the format of the date we're going to use. Set this property to be `@"yyyy-MM-dd"`. This will allow us to create a date from a string year, month, day, like `@"2017-07-24"`.
* `NSDateFormatter` has a method called `dateFromString:` that accepts an `NSString` and returns an `NSDate`. Call this method on the date formatter to create a new date object using your birthday as the date in the string.
* Print out this new date to make sure it was created correctly.

Your code should look something like this:

```objective-c
NSDateFormatter *formatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
formatter.dateFormat = @"yyyy-MM-dd";
NSDate *date = [formatter dateFromString:@"1992-04-03"];
```

>
* `NSDate` has a method called `timeIntervalSinceNow` that returns the number of seconds between now and the date. It returns this as a `NSTimeInterval` which is an Objective-C primative similar to double. 
* Call the `timeIntervalSinceNow` method on your birthday and save the result in an `NSTimeInterval` variable. 
* Print out the result of this to the console to see how old you are in seconds. Notice that the number is negative, that's just because it's calculating the number of seconds between now and a date in the past.

### Considerations

* What else can you do with `NSDate`?
  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Learned the basics of `NSDate` and `NSDateFormatter`
