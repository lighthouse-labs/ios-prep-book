Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

* Click finish, and create, and you're done.
* Next add a new property to this class called `name` and make it a type of `NSString`.
* Create a new class called `Dog`.
* Add a `name` property to this class as well.

#### Create objects from your classes

* In main.m, create a new instance of `Person`.
* Give this new person a name.
* Do the same with `Dog`.

#### Modify a class

* Navigate back to the person class and add a property called `pet` whose type is `Dog`.
* In main.m, set the dog instance as the person's `pet`.
* Try giving the person multiple pets. What happens?

#### Add a method

* In the `Dog` class, add a method called `speak`.
* Add `NSLog(@"Woof")` to this method.
* In main.m call the `speak` method on the person's pets.

## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Create custom classes and instances of those classes.
* Learned the difference between a class and an object or instance.

If you feel like you are unclear on any of these objectives, make sure to ask a mentor for assistance. Don't forget to commit your work.
