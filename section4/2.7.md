# Assignment 4: Find the Largest Number in an Array

Write a method that finds the highest number in an unsorted array and returns it. It should work for any array of numbers being passed in ex) `@[@3, @7, @6, @8]` or `@[@44, @5, @6]`

>
Note:
In Objective-C, there is a built in way of finding the largest number in an array, and it looks like this `[array valueForKeyPath:@"@max.intValue"]`. Do not do it this way in your assignment. We want you to write your own algorithm from scratch.
