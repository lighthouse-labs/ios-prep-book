# Assignment 3: Toyotas are Cars too!

1. Create a new Command Line Tool project and pick Objective-C as the language.
2. Create a Class called Car. Add a NSString property called model.
3. Create a method called drive. Inside the method put an **NSLog **statement that prints the model of the car you are driving.
4. Create a **initWithModel:** method that requires an `NSString  *model` as an input. Inside the method set `_model = model.` This will set the class's model to the model you pass in.
5. Subclass Car and make a Toyota Class. Override **init()** and set `_model` to *"Prius"* inside the method.
6. In main.m, add an instance of a Car called nissan. Initialize it with model named "Rogue".
7. Add the **drive()** method to make sure it prints out "Rogue"
8. Then, add an instance of Toyota called *toyota*. Initialize it.
9. Add the **drive()** method to make sure it prints out "Prius"
