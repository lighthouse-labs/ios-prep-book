# Collections

## Goal

In this challenge, you will create a new command line app to hold an array of `NSString` instances listing your favorite sports. You print out the contents of this array to the console. You will end by using an `NSDictionary` to associate an emoji for each sport, which you will log to the console.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Learn how to create an array of strings.
* Learn how to mutate an array.
* Use fast enumeration to print out the values in an array.
* Create a dictionary to map associated data.

## Exercise

* Start by creating a new Xcode project called Sports, and navigate to the `main.m` file.

#### Create an array of sports

* Create a new `NSArray` called sports and initialize it with the names of all of your favorite sports as `NSString`s literals.

> Note: There are a few different ways to initialize an `NSArray`. Prefer the literal notation. Checkout [this](https://joris.kluivers.nl/blog/2012/03/13/new-objectivec-literal-syntax/) quick post on the topic. Using literal initialization looks like this:

```Objective-C
NSArray *myArray = @[@"hello", @"from", @"lighthouse"];
```

* Use `NSLog` to print out the second sport in the array.

> Note: Access arrays in modern Objective-C using subscript notation (like: `myArray[3]`) rather than `objectAtIndex:`.

#### NSMutableArray

* `NSArray` is an *immutable* array. This means that once you've created the array, you can never add new items or remove items "in place".
* `NSArray` methods like `- subarrayWithRange:` create a new `NSArray` instance that is a subarray of the original. The original array is never altered.
* In order to add or remove elements "in place" we need to use an `NSMutableArray`.

#### Make the sports array mutable

* Change your sports array to be an `NSMutableArray`.
* Use the `removeLastObject` method on the array to delete the last sport from the list.
* Now use the `insertObject: atIndex` method to add that sport to the beginning of the array.

#### Print out the sports

* Use `NSLog` to print out the first sport in the array. Confirm that this element is the last element before the change.
* Next use fast enumeration (`for-in loop`) to loop through the array of sports.
* Print out the name of each sport.

#### Use a dictionary for the emojis

* Create an NSDictionary called sportEmojis that maps each sport to an emoji `NSString` literal.
* For example, the entry for hockey would be key = @"Hockey", value = @"🏒".
* You can access emoji under the edit menu of Xcode (or by using `⌃ + ⌘ + ␣` key binding).
* Use the `NSDictionary`'s literal initialization syntax (check [this](https://joris.kluivers.nl/blog/2012/03/13/new-objectivec-literal-syntax/) post).
* There are a few ways to loop through an `NSDictionary`. Since `NSDictionary` is unordered, the way we are going to do it is by getting an array of the keys using the property `allKeys`. This will return an array. Use the returned array to perform fast enumeration (`for-in loop`) and log each emoji associated with that key to the console.

>
```objective-c
NSLog(@"%@", sportEmojis[key]);
```

### Considerations

* Remember that the index of an array starts at 0, so the first element in an array is at index 0.

## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Created an immutable `NSArray` using literal syntax.
* Used fast enumeration (`for-in loop`).
* Created a mutable array (`NSMutableArray`).
* Mutated an `NSMutableArray` instance.
* Create an `NSDictionary` to map associated data.
* Looped through an `NSDictionary` using the keys.

If you feel like you are unclear on any of these objectives, make sure to ask a mentor for assistance. Don't forget to commit your work.
