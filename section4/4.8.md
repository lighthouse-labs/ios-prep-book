# Collections

## Goal

In this challenge, you will create a new Command Line app to hold an array of your favorite sports. You will then use this array to print out the name of your favorite sports to the console. Then you will use a dictionary to help print out sport emojis instead of just the sport names.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Learn how to create an array of strings.
* Learn how to mutate an array.
* Use fast enumeration to print out the values in an array.
* Create a dictionary to map associated data.

## Exercise

>
* Start by creating a new Xcode project called Sports, and navigate to the `main.m` file.

#### Create an array of sports

>
* Create a new `NSArray` called sports and initialize it with the names of all of your favorite sports.
* Use `NSLog` to print out the second sport in the array.

#### Mutate the array of sports

`NSArray` is an *immutable* array. This means that once you've created the array, you can never change its contents. In order to update an array, you need to use an `NSMutableArray`.

>
* Change your sports array to be an `NSMutableArray`.
* Use the `removeLastObject` method on the array to delete the last sport from the list. 
* Now use the `insertObject:atIndex` method to add that sport to the beginning of the array.
* Use `NSLog` to print out the second sport in the array. It should be different now.

#### Print out the sports

>
* Use fast enumeration to loop through the array of sports.
* Print out the name of each sport.
* Instead of just printing out the string directly, print out an emoji for the sport instead. Example: If the sport is Hockey, print out 🏒. (To bring up the emoji keyboard, press ctrl+cmd+space)

#### Use a dictionary for the emojis

>
* Create an NSDictionary called sportEmojis that maps all the sports to an emoji. For example, the entry for hockey would be key = @"Hockey", value = @"🏒"
* Now use this dictionary to refactor the loop that prints out emojis. For example, to print the hockey emoji you're code would something like this: 

>
```objective-c
NSLog(@"%@", sportEmojis[@"Hockey"]);
```

### Considerations

* Remember that the index of an array starts at 0, so the first element in an array is at index 0.
  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Created and mutated an array.
* Create a dictionary to map associated data.
* Used fast enumeration to print the contents of an array.
