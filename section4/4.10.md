# Custom Methods

## Goal

In this challenge you will go back to the Largest Number assignment, and refactor the code to encapsulate the algorithm in its own object.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Create methods that accept input parameters and return a value.
* Learn to use objects to organize code.

## Reading and Videos

### Required

Lynda:

* [Adding methods](https://www.lynda.com/Objective-C-tutorials/Adding-methods/143328/157000-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a8%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aobjective+c%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)


## Exercise

>
* Start by opening your Largest Number assignment.

#### Encapsulate your algorithm in an object

>
* Create a new class and name it `ArrayUtility`.
* Create a new method called `largestNumber`. This method should accepts an `NSArray` as a parameter and return an `NSNumber`.
* Use your algorithm from `main.m` as the body of this method.
* Now use this new object to find the lagest number in the array.

#### Add more methods

Use the `largestNumber` method as a reference for the following steps:

>
* Add a new method to find the smallest number.
* Add a new method to find the median number.


### Considerations

* Notice how we can use objects to keep our code organized.
* What other methods could you add to this utility class?
  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Created methods that accept input parameters and return a value.
* Learned to use objects to organize code.

If you feel like you are unclear on any of these objectives, make sure to ask a mentor for assistance! Don't forget to commit your work.
