# Initializers

## Goal

In this challenge you will be creating a custom initializer for the `Person` class from 4 challenges ago. You will use the custom initializer to set the person's `name` and `pet`.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Create a custom initializer with multiple arguments.
* Learn why custom initializers are useful.

## Exercise

* Open your project from [Creating Custom Classes](../section4/4.9.md)

#### Create a custom initializer

* Navigate to the `Person` class.
* Create a new initializer with a `pet` parameter and a `name` parameter.
* In this initializer, set the pet and name property of the person.
* In main.m, create your person object using your new initializer.
* Since you're setting the `name` and `pet` in the initializer, you can remove any code in `main.m` that sets these properties directly.


#### Readonly property

* We're going to add a `dateOfBirth` property to our person class. This is a special property, because a person's date of birth will never change.
* If we make our property `readonly` then we can set it during initialization.
* External callers will only be able to read and won't be able to write to the property. This models the fact that a person's birth date never changes.

### Add `dateOfBirth` to Person

* In the `Person` class, add a new `NSDate` property called `dateOfBirth`.
* Make this property `readonly` so external callers cannot call the property setter.
* Add a `dateOfBirth` parameter to your custom initializer and use it to set the `dateOfBirth` property.
* Now when you create a new `Person` object, give that person a date of birth using an `NSDate` object. Feel free to use `[NSDate date];` to set the person's date of birth to right now.


### Considerations

* What's happening when a property is set to `readonly`?
* What happens when you try to update the `dateOfBirth` using dot syntax? `person.dateOfBirth = [NSDate date];`

## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Learned the basics of custom initializers.
* Learned about `readonly` properties.

If you feel like you are unclear on any of these objectives, make sure to ask a mentor for assistance. Don't forget to commit your work.
