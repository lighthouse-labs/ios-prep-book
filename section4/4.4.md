# Getting Started with Objective-C

In this section you will be using the Lynda.com and Big Nerd Ranch resources to learn and practice Objective-C. Make sure you have access to both of these resources before continuing.

This section is broken up into separate challenges that you must complete. Each challenge comes with required reading material and or Lynda videos to watch.

To get the most out of this course, make sure you practice what you're learning during the videos and readings. You should be spending more time writing code than you do watching or reading.

Before you start on any of the challenges, go to the [Lynda.com Objective-C Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Objective-C-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/143328-2.html) course and watch sections 1-3. These videos will contain some review of what you've already learned mixed with some new topics and concepts.
