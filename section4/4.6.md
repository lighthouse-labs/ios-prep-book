# Intro to Objects and NSString

## Goal

In this challenge you will create a new Command Line app to manipulate text. You will be using the built in `NSString` class and its methods to do this.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Create objects using the `NSString` class.
* Call methods on your `NSString` objects.
* Create new strings by calling methods on existing strings.

### Additional

* [NSString methods](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsstring?language=objc)


## Exercise

>
* Start by creating a new Xcode project called Strings, and navigate to the `main.m` file.

#### Create a new string

>
* The first thing you're going to do is create a new object with the type `NSString`. Call this object `name` and set it's value to be your name.
* Now use NSLog to print out the value of this new object. Remember to use `%@` to print the value of an object.

#### Start calling methods

The `NSString` class has a method called `length` that returns the length of the string as an `NSUInteger`.

>
* Call the `length` method on your name string, and save the returned value as a new `NSUInteger` variable. 
* Now print the length of the string using `NSLog`.

#### Manipulate the string

Calling any one of the following methods on a string, will return a new string object. This new object will be the same as the original string, with some sort of manipulation done. 

- `uppercaseString`
- `lowercaseString`
- `stringByAppendingString`
- `stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString:`

For example, this is what `uppercaseString` might look like:

```obj-c
NSString *bootcamp = @"Lighthouse Labs";
NSString *bootcampUppercase = [bootcamp uppercaseString];
NSLog(@"%@", bootcampUppercase);
``` 
```
> LIGHTHOUSE LABS
```

>
* Test out each of those methods on your name variable and print the results.

#### Madlib

Now we're going to have some fun with the `stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString:` method, by creating a madlib. 

>
* Copy and paste the following code into your project:

```objective-c
NSString *madLib = @"Yesterday, _PERSON_ and I when to the park. On our way to the _ADJECTIVE_1 park, we saw a _ADJECTIVE_2 _NOUN_ on a bike. We also saw big _ADJECTIVE_2 balloons tied to the _NOUN_. Once we got to the _ADJECTIVE_1 park, the sky turned _ADJECTIVE_2. It started to _VERB_. _PERSON_ and I _VERB_ all the way home.";

madLib = [madLib stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"_PERSON_" withString:@""];
madLib = [madLib stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"_ADJECTIVE_1" withString:@""];
madLib = [madLib stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"_ADJECTIVE_2" withString:@""];
madLib = [madLib stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"_NOUN_" withString:@""];
madLib = [madLib stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"_VERB_" withString:@""];

NSLog(@"%@", madLib);
```

>
* Now replace all the empty strings with your own Person, Adjectives, Noun, and Verb.
* Try coming up with your own mad lib.

  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Learned the basics of `NSString`
