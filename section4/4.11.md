# Instance Variables

## Goal

In this challenge you will manually set up properties on a custom object using instance variables and a getter and setter method.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Learn what happens behind the scenes when you create a property.
* Manually implement properties without using `@property`.

## Reading and Videos

### Required

Lynda:

* [Adding class properties](https://www.lynda.com/Objective-C-tutorials/Adding-class-properties/143328/157001-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a8%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aobjective+c%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)

* [Your First Class](https://books.google.ca/books?id=yxwiAgAAQBAJ&q=NSArray#v=snippet&q=Your%20First%20Class&f=false)


## Exercise

>
* Follow along with the example in the `Your First Class` chapter of Big Nerd Ranch. You should create a `B​N​R​P​e​r​s​o​n` object.​
* Add a new property to this person called `eyeColor` and make its type `NSString`. Instead of using `@property`, create an ivar, getter, and setter manually.
* After creating a new instance of `B​N​R​P​e​r​s​o​n`, set the eye color using dot syntax. Example: `person.eyeColor = @"blue";`
  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Learned what happens behind the scenes when you create a property.
* Manually implement properties using an ivar, getter method, and setter method.
