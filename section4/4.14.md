# Inheritance

## Goal

In this challenge you will create a Vehicle class and create Train and Bicycle subclasses that inhert from Vehicle. You will then be able to override methods and add new properties to the subclasses.

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Create a super class and a subclass.
* Understand that the subclass inherits from the superclass.
* Override a superclass' method.
* Add more properties to the subclasses.

## Exercise

>
* Start by creating a new Xcode project.

#### Create a new Vehicle class

You will start by creating a `Vehicle` class that will be foundation for any vehicles you want to create in this project.

>
* Create a new Vehicle class.
* Add a `currentSpeed` property. Use `double` as the type.
* Override the `description` method in `Vehicle` to return the speed of the vehicle. Example:

>
```objective-c
[NSString stringWithFormat:@"traveling at %f miles per hour", self.currentSpeed];`
```

>
* Create a method called `- (void)makeNoise` but leave the body of the method blank. An arbitrary vehicle doesn't necessarily make a noise.

#### Create a Train class 

>
* Create a new class called `Train` and have it subclass `Vehicle` instead of `NSObject`.
* In `Train.m` override the `- (void)makeNoise` to `NSLog(@"Choo Choo")`.
* In `main.m`, create a new instance of `Train`.
* Set its speed to any value you like.
* Call `makeNoise` method on the train.
* Use `NSLog` to print the train's description.

>
```objective-c
NSLog@"%@", train);
```

#### Create a Bicycle class 

>
* Create a new class called `Bicycle` and have it subclass `Vehicle` instead of `NSObject`.
* In `Bicycle.m` override the `- (void)makeNoise` to `NSLog(@"Ding")`.
* Create a new property on `Bicycle` called `hasBasket` that has a type of `BOOL`.
* Override the description method of the `Bicycle` to mention if it has a basket. Your code should look something like this:

>
 ```objective-c
if (self.hasBasket) {
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"traveling at %f miles per hour with a basket", self.currentSpeed];
} 
return [super description];
```

>
* In `main.m`, create a new instance of `Bicycle`.
* Set its speed to any value you like.
* Give it a basket.
* Call `makeNoise` method on the bicycle.
* Use `NSLog` to print the bicycle's description.

#### Keep going

>
* Keep playing around with different subclasses. Try creating a `TandemBicycle` that subclasses `Bicycle`.

### Considerations

*
  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Created a base class and subclasses of that class.
* Learned that the subclass inherits from the superclass.
* Overridden a superclass' method.
* Added more properties to the subclasses.

If you feel like you are unclear on any of these objectives, make sure to ask a mentor for assistance! Don't forget to commit your work.
