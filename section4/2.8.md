# Pushing Your Work to Github

---

The steps below are all executed in terminal.

**1. `cd` into Your Repo:**
`cd` into the root folder that you have used to store all of your assignments: `cd ~/Desktop/lighthouse/assignments`

**2. Remove Any Existing `.git` Folders From Subfolders:**
If you accidentally added git to any of the projects that are subfolders this will cause git confusion. So, we must remove these first. `cd` into each subfolder of `assignments` (the root level is probably good enough). and type `ls -la`. This will show all files/folder including hidden ones. If you see a `.git` folder then we must delete all of these first. To do so type `rm -fr .git`. Do another `ls -la` to check that the folder was deleted. If you run into trouble ask on the forum.

**3. Initialize Your Repo:**
Next we will need to initialize the repo. Make sure you are in the root folder of your assignments. So `cd` back into it if you need to. Now type `git init` and press enter. You can check to make sure the `.git` folder is there using the steps above.

**4. Add Your Files To the Staging Area:**
Next we have to start tracking our files and add them to the staging area. Just type `git add .` This will add all of the files to the index so that any future changes to them will be noticed by git. It also adds them to the staging area which is a holding area that makes them ready for being committed.

**5. Committing:**
Committing just takes a snapshot of our tracked files in their current state. Just type `git commit -m "my brilliant message"` Replace the message with your own helpful message describing your changes.

**6. Adding a Remote Repo:**
Next we need to connect our local repo to a remote repo so that others can interact with it.

Start by logging into [github.com](https://github.com). On the right side you will see a + button. Click create a new repo from the drop down. Call it something meaningful. Click the big green button that says "create repository".

Next you will see an important screen. Look carefully at what its saying.

You want to paste the line that starts `git remote add origin...` and the line `git push -u origin master` into terminal. Paste these lines in one at a time or all in one. Hit enter. Look at the message in terminal.

If everything is connected your local repo is now in sync with the remote one. Refesh the GitHub web page and make sure you can see all of your files.

From now on any local changes can be added, committed, and pushed to the remote so that other GitHub users can see, clone and change the contents.

Please remember to include the link to your repo when you email your work to lighthouse.
