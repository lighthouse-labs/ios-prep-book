* In 2014 Apple introduced a new programming language called Swift. At Lighthouse we love Swift.

* But our objective is to make you job ready by the end of the program.

* The vast majority of our graduates still get jobs because of their knowledge of Objective-C, which is still in wide use especially for mission critical applications. Swift only developers are not currently taken as seriously in the industry.

* As such we currently teach our program in 50% Objective-C and 50% Swift.

* We find that starting with Objective-C is a more logical place to start, since Swift builds on many of the core ideas of Objective-C.

* In this next section we have 2 main resources to get you up to speed on Objective-C.

* These are a video series and an excellent written resource.

* The order of presentation is just a suggestion. Feel free to change the order to suit your own learning style.

* Once you are finished the materials please do the brief assignments and push all of your assignments to GitHub (see the complete instructions below).
