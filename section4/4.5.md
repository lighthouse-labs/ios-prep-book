# Primitive Data Types

## Goal

In this challenge you will create a simple calculator Command Line app that can add, subtract, multiple, and divide two numbers. 

Remember to commit your code to git after each step.

## Objectives

* Use Objective-C Primitive types.
* Create and use a custom enum.

## Exercise

>
* Start by creating a new Xcode project called Calculator, and navigate to the `main.m` file.

#### Setup your variables

>
* Create 3 `NSIntegers` called `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, `result`.
* Set the initial values of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` to any numeric value you like.
* Set the result to be the product of the two numbers.
* Use `NSLog` to print out the value of all 3 numbers.

#### Choose which opperation to perform

Your calculator can currently multiply any two numbers together, but it needs to be able to add, subtract, multiple, and divide two numbers. How can we decide which opperation to perform?

>
* Create a new `enum` called `operation` with a case for `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Make sure you create this outside of the `main` function.
* Create a new variable called `currentOperation`, its type should be the opperation enum.
* Set it's value to be one of the four opperators. 

Your main function should look something like this:

```objective-c
int main() {
    
    NSInteger firstNumber = 10;
    NSInteger secondNumber = 3;
    NSInteger result = 0;
    
    enum operation currentOperation = multiply;
```

>
* Now use a switch statement to check which operation is the current operation.
* Perform the appropriate math operation inside the switch statement. So addition might look something like this:

>
```c
case add:
    result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
    break;
```

>
* Try changing the `currentOperation` to see if the correct opperation gets performed.  

### Considerations

* Could you create a seperate function to perform the operations?
  
## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

* Used Objective-C Primitive types.
* Created and use a custom enum.
* Learned when it can be useful to use enums.

If you feel like you are unclear on any of these objectives, make sure to ask a mentor for assistance! Don't forget to commit your work.
