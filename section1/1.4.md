# Character Arrays: Lists of Characters

An Array is nothing more than a list of variables of the same data type.

1. Command-Line tool called Array
2. Copy the code into your editor
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
   int i,j;

   /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */         
   for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
      n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i + 100 */
   }

   /* output each array element's value */
   for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) {
      printf("Element[%d] = %d\n", j, n[j] );
   }

   return 0;
}
```

### Note
As you can see we are getting the value at an elements location by adding brackets to `n` like this `n[]` with a number inside it `n[1]` outputs 101.

### Research

- Ask Google why array's start from the position 0.
- Create a variable that can hold a list of characters like `char *street = "123 Fake Street."` and print the value of `street[6]`;

----
### Challenge

Write a program that outputs the 4th character of the month September.
