### Introduction
iOS applications are written in Objective-C (as well as the newly introduced Swift, which we will cover later in the course when you are in Lighthouse). Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language built on top of the C programming language. We are going to learn the fundamentals of C in this section and then move on to Objective-C in the next section.

### C
C is an efficient and relatively small programming language. In other words, you don't have to learn many *commands* in C. Throughout this section, you will learn about C commands. and other elements of the C language, such as operators, loops and functions.

Before we write our first C program I recommend the following brief video series that will introduce you to the language. The final video in the series is not required.
