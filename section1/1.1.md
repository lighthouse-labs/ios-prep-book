# Writing your first C program

Let's jump right in and take a look at a complete C program:

```c
include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	printf("Hello world!");
	return 0;
}
```

### The breakdown

Understanding every line we write in a program is required in order to make sure our code compiles properly.  Let's breakdown every single line in the C program above.

`/* Prints "Hello world!" on the screen */`

* is a comment in C
* We'll use comments in help clarify what our program does for both us and the readers of our program
* Don't worry to much about how to write a comment, we will cover that soon!


`include <stdio.h>`

* is a statement which tells the compiler to insert the contents of **stdio** at that particular place.
* In C we use some functions like **printf()**, **scanf()**,
Do we define it? No.
* These functions are not defined by the programmer. These functions are already defined inside the language library. To use these kinds of predefined functions, we have to include the corresponding header file.

```c
int main() {

}
```

* the most important part of a C program is the **main()** function. At this point the distinction is not critical, **main()** is a C *function*, not a C command
* A function is nothing more than a routine that performs some task
* Some functions come with C and some are created by you. C programs are made up of one or more functions. Each program must *always* include a **main()** function. A function is distinguished from a command by the parenthesis that follow the function name.

These are functions:
**main()**, **printf()**, **strlen()**

and these are commands:
**return**, **while**, **int**, **if** etc...

Last but not least, what is inside our **main()** function:
```c
printf("Hello world!");
return 0;
```
* The first line prints `Hello world!` to the screen
* The second line we need not worry about now but it is the value our function returns and 0 means the program is successful.

### The main() function

Just as the home page is the beginning place to surf a website, **main()** is always the first place the computer begins when running your program. Even if **main()** is not the first function listed in your program, **main()** still determines the beginning of the program's execution.

After the word **main()**, you always see an opening brace `({)`. When you find a matching closing brace `(})`, **main()** is finished.

That wasn't so bad, right! Pat yourself on the back for experiencing your first program in C. :)
