# Assignment 2: Two doors

Read the code and find the bugs

```c

    printf("Welcome to Two doors.\n");

        print("One of the doors will guide you to freedom and behind the other is a hangman --you don't know which is which.\n");
        print("One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You don't know which one is the truth-teller or the liar either.\n");
        print("You have to choose and open one of these doors, but you can only ask a single question to one of the guards.\n");
        print("What do you ask so you can pick the door to freedom?\n\n");

**Goal**

Make the program compile

**Stretch goals**

Make it so the user is asked to play the game over again. If the user presses y start the game from the beginning. If they press n stop the program.
