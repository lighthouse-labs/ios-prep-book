# ![Github](/images/github-big.png) Setting up Git & A GitHub Account

----

### Step 1

Go into the lighthouse folder and make sure that you are using the e-mail address which you used when setting up your Git account.

    git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'

**Note:** If you mistype your email, you can run this command again (use the up/down arrow keys in Terminal to cycle through history)

### Step 2

Again, make sure that this is the username which you originally used to set up your Git account.

    git config --global user.name 'Your Name'

**Note:** If you mistype your name, you can run this command up (use the up/down arrow keys in Terminal to cycle through history)

### Step 3

> SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. We would like GitHub to not require us to login for every action. To do so we must connect our account with our computer using SSH keys.

The steps below will walk you through generating an SSH key and then adding the public key to your GitHub account.

In your terminal, type the following commands:


```
cd ~/.ssh
```

```
ls -al
```

Check the directory listing to see if you have files named either `id_rsa.pub` or `id_dsa.pub`. 

If you don't have either of those files go to **Configuring a New Key**. Otherwise, you can skip to **Adding Your Public Key to GitHub**.

### Configuring a New Key

To generate a new SSH key, copy and paste the commands below. Make sure to replace `your_email@example.com` with your own email. 

The default settings are preferred. So when you're asked to "enter a file in which to save the key" just press enter to continue.

```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
```

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```

You should see something like the following:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): 
[Press enter]
```

Next, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase. Leave it blank (just hit enter without typing any other characters), as demonstrated below.

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter]
Enter the same passphrase again: [Press enter]
```

This should give you something like this:

```
Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com
```

Next add your new key to the ssh-agent like this:

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Adding Your Public Key to GitHub

Type the following:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This will give you a big block of characters which you should highlight and copy from your Terminal window.

In your browser, visit the GitHub [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/admin) screen.

Click on **SSH Keys** on the left sidebar.

Click **Add SSH Key**

In the Title field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, since you're using a computer for Lighthouse, you might call this key "Your computers name"

Paste your key into the "Key" field.

Click **Add key**.

Confirm the action by entering your GitHub password.

**NOTE:** It's okay to have multiple SSH keys setup in your Github settings. It just means multiple machines have access to pull and push to Github using your account credentials.

And that's it. You've finished setting up your mac, which you will be using going forward! Next let's get to some real work! ;)

**Helpful Resources:**

Be forewarned that Git can get "deep". Stick to the basics to avoid getting overwhelmed. Below you will find a very good resources for gitting (ðŸš‘) started with git. There are additional recommended resources at the end of the prep course, but this should get you started.
