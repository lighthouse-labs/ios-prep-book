# ![](/images/terminal-big.png) Setup Terminal

The Terminal is a program included with all versions of Mac OS X. It is used to access the operating and file system in a much more powerful way than Finder. As a developer you will make extensive use of the Terminal.

As a convenience it's a good idea to drag Terminal to the Dock for easy access. 

Step 1: Location the Terminal App in **Applications > Utilities**.

Step 2: Drag the Terminal App to the Dock. This will create an alias in your Dock so that you can easily access it.
