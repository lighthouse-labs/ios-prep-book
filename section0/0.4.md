# ![Github](/images/github-big.png) Setting up GitHub

----

Git is a version control system used by most developers. We will setup Git in a moment. Before doing so we will first setup GitHub. 

GitHub is a website for storing git repositories (repos). These are programming source files, and other assets. Git allows very powerful history tracking of your projects including the ability to revert. GitHub is a remote website for storing source files that are under git version control. This allows others to access, view, clone (download), alter and collaborate.

Our first order of business is to setup a GitHub account if you don't already have one. 

Simply go to [github.com](https://github.com) and signup.

Take a look around the site. 

Here's a short video to get you started on GitHub:
