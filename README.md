**Touchpoint meetings:**  
We'll be contacting you regularly to setup Skype/Google Hangout conversations to see how things are going.

**Due Date:**  
The prep course is due 2 weeks before the bootcamp starts. This allows for time to give you feedback on the submitted work to make sure you are ready for Day 1.

As you are progressing through the course you will be required to submit various assignments. Here is the list of assignments that will require submission.

* FizzBuzz

##### Where to Get Help

As a registered Lighthouse Labs student, if you don't understand or get stuck on something, you have access to our private [iOS Prep Discussion Forum](http://ios-prep.lighthouselabs.ca/login). Please contact the admissions person you've been in contact with to gain forum access if you have not yet received.

This private discussion forum exists solely for students preparing for the bootcamp. You can seek out prep course assistance from course instructors, mentors and fellow students on the forum. If youre question has not been already addressed please submit it as a new Topic \(one problem per topic please; feel free to create multiple topics if you are stuck in multiple places\). You should receive an e-mail notification for any posted replies.

You are encouraged to discuss your progress and challenges on the forum. The more you do this, the better prepared you'll be for class. You may want to even try tackling any unanswered posted questions.

#### When to Ask for Help

You are expected to work through the questions and assignments to the best of your ability. But you may get stuck. We are here to help and make sure you spend your time efficiently.

As a rule of thumb, **if you are stuck on something for more than 30 min** you should go to the forum for assistance. Chances are somebody else is stuck, or has been stuck in the same spot and can help.

#### Required Laptop Specs

We require you to bring a portable Mac computer running either Yosemite or Sierra. Your computer must have a minimum of 4 GBs or RAM, but 8 or more is recommended. \(Macs that do not have Solid State drives or Hybrid drives will experience slow compile times, which could prove annoying\).
